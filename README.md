# Model-housing
ðŸš€ Excited to share my AI project!

As a passionate AI Engineer, Iâ€™m diving into real-world Machine Learning applications. This project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

**ðŸ“Œ Project:** House Price Prediction
**ðŸŽ¯ Objective:** Predict median house prices using structured data with Python and scikit-learn.

**ðŸ›  Tech Stack:**

* Python
* pandas & NumPy â†’ data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation
* scikit-learn â†’ model training, evaluation, and optimization
* Matplotlib â†’ visualization of data trends and model results

**ðŸ”Ž Approach:**

1. Data exploration and cleaning
2. Feature selection and preprocessing (scaling, encoding categorical variables)
3. Training multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
4. Evaluating model performance with RMSE and RÂ²
5. Selecting the best-performing model for predictions

**ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights:**

* Feature engineering significantly improved predictive accuracy.
* Tree-based models outperformed simple linear regression.
* Housing prices showed strong correlations with location, number of rooms, and lot size.

**âœ… Outcome:**
This project highlights how machine learning can be applied to real-world business cases in the housing market, enabling more accurate and data-driven price estimations.
